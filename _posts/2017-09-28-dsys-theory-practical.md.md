title: Distributed Systems Theory for Practical Engineers

description: Alvaro Videla reviews the different models - asynchronous vs. synchronous distributed systems, message passing vs shared memory communication, failure detectors and leader election problems, etc. He also reviews a series of books on distributed systems in order to recommend the best one according to the topics we would like to learn about, or the problems we would like to solve.
